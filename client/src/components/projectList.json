This app utilizes a complex set of tables and relations including items and characters in a many to many association through a join table. Interactions to the sql were handled through mysql and sequelize and information was passed back and forth on an express server using api-routes.",

But ideally these recommendations will occupy you for around an hour to an afternoon because I feel that the app shines the most when the suggestions are spontaneous!",
